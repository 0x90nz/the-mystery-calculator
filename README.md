# The Mystery Calculator

I got a little game from a christmas cracker called "The Mystery Calculator"
which has a bunch of cards with numbers on each. The player selects a number
from any card and through asking whether the number is present on all given
cards, the number can be determined.

The original cards have numbers from 1-63, but this and a few other settings can
be adjusted with command line options. See `-h` or `--help` for more detail.

The mechanism by which it operates is pretty simple to figure out, but can be a
fun exercise. If you don't already know, try to figure it out just by looking at
the output. A sample run is included below for convenience.

The below output is a run in which I chose 12 as my number:
